# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Computer Vision

Welcome to my repository for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation in the field of computer vision! This project showcases my journey into the fascinating world of deep learning, particularly focused on image recognition and analysis.

## Introduction

Ever since ChatGPT emerged, it has been an invaluable tool in my quest to learn Solidity and smart contract development. It has significantly accelerated my learning process, and I've gained a deep appreciation for the transformative potential of AI. In today's world, AI has democratized access to knowledge, allowing anyone with curiosity to learn almost anything at a rapid pace. This project was inspired by the [PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA)  developed by Daniel Bourke. After completing this course, my perspective on the near future of humanity has profoundly shifted. This transformation stems from the realization of the inherent beauty and immense power of neural networks, which are poised to have profound impacts on society. The fact that anyone can access this invaluable knowledge for free on YouTube is truly remarkable, and I highly recommend it to anyone with a curious mind.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:
- A Google Colab Notebook containing the code for my first CNN network, implemented using PyTorch.
- Datasets and resources used for training and testing the CNN.
- Documentation and explanations of the network architecture and its components.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:
- To showcase my initial steps in building and training a CNN.
- To provide a clear example of a CNN's structure and functionality.
- To share my learning process and insights with the community.
